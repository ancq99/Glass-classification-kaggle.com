# Glass-classification-kaggle.com
A repo for glass classification project from kaggle.com website. 

The main purpose of this project, was to learn the basics of machine learning, work with various classifiers such as: KNN, Decision Tree, ADA Boost etc. and practice data analysis.

We also tried to improve clasification results by using popular methods like data duplication, data normalization and PCA-principal component analysis.

The project was created in Jupyter Lab and you can find there full data analysis, classifications and visualizations of results.
